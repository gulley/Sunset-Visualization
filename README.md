# Sunset Times

This app shows the time of sunset for the next two weeks. 

A working version of this page is deployed here:

[Sunset Times](https://gulley.github.io/Sunset-Visualization/)


## To do
- Add a link to show the current location
- Clean up labels at the top
- Add option to show either sunrise or sunset times


## Done
- Put in a pink line to show the day of the earliest sunset
- Make sure the times match the geo-located position.
- Clean up table at the bottom
- Use the SunCalc library instead of the current (very old) one.
