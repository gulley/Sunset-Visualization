# Sunset Times

A working version of this page is deployed here:

[Sunset Times](https://gulley.github.io/Sunset-Visualization/)

This is a file for determining what the time of sunset will be doing for the next two weeks.

- Sunset algorithm is courtesy of http://prestonhunt.com/story/124
- Hunt did a Javascript implementation of the algorithm found at http://williams.best.vwh.net/sunrise_sunset_algorithm.htm

## To do
- Make sure the times match the geo-located position.
- Use the SunCalc library instead of the current (very old) one.
- Clean up labels at the top
- Clean up table at the bottom
- Put in a pink line to show the day of the earliest sunset
- Add option to show sunrise or sunset times
